<h3 id="basic-explaination">Basic Explaination</h3>
<p>A Trigger may optionally be wrapped in parenthesis but must alway begin with a number
from 0-9 and a colon in the middle to seperate the trigger's category, which is the
first number, and the trigger's id, which is the last group of numbers.</p>
<p>Triggers are grouped into &quot;blocks&quot;.  Blocks start with a Cause (see below) trigger
and usually end with a Effect (see below) trigger.</p>
<h5 id="trigger-example">Trigger Example:</h5>
<p><code>(</code> Optional wrapping parenthesis</p>
<p><code>0</code> The trigger's category.  Triggers are categorized as Causes, Conditions, Effects and Flow.</p>
<ul>
<li>0 Cause = Nothing happens without a Cause.  It is the first trigger executed in a group of triggers.
You could look at it as event based.  A Cause is called when something happens.</li>
<li>1 Conditions = These are triggers act as a &quot;if-then-continue&quot;.  If the condition succeeds then the
rest of the triggers after the condition are executed, if the condition fails then the entire block
is exited.</li>
<li>5 Effects = Better known as actions!  These triggers perform the work.  They could do a file write
operation, play music, popup a window, etc.  They must always perform work.</li>
<li>6 Flow = No, they have nothing to do with liquid.  These triggers are for executing a block of
triggers with a loop or a iterator.  They are slightly more advanced but fear not, there are
limitations set so that you will not encounter a infinite loop scenario.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>:</code> A seperator between the category and the id.</p>
<p><code>123</code> A group of numbers that give the trigger a id.</p>
<ul>
<li>Id = Any group of numbers that identify that specific trigger.  A Cause can have a category of
450 and a Effect can have a id of 450.  As long as you don't have two of the same id in one
category or a exception will be thrown.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this comes together to form a trigger <code>(0:123)</code>.</p>
<h3 id="basic-usage">Basic Usage</h3>
<p>For simplicity sake, in this example, we will assume trigger (0:0) has already been given a handler.</p>
<p>Let's say you had a Monkeyspeak script like this:</p>
<pre><code>(0:0) when the script is started,
        (5:100) set %hello to {Hello World}.
        (5:101) set %num to 5.1212E+003.
        (5:102) print {num = %num} to the console.
        (5:102) print {%hello} to the console.
</code></pre>
<p>You would load and execute it using a few methods:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">using Monkeyspeak;

var engine = new MonkeyspeakEngine();
Page page = engine.LoadFromString(testScript);

page.Error += DebugAllErrors;

page.LoadAllLibraries();

page.Execute(); // optionally provide the trigger Id of 0 to execute (0:0)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>num = 5121.2
Hello World
</code></pre>
<h3 id="advanced-usage">Advanced Usage</h3>
<p>Here is a example of using Flow triggers</p>
<pre><code>(0:0) when the script is started,
    (5:250) create a table as %myTable.
    (5:100) set %hello to {hi}
    (5:252) with table %myTable put {%hello} in it at key {myKey1}.
    (5:252) with table %myTable put {%hello} in it at key {myKey2}.
    (5:252) with table %myTable put {%hello} in it at key {myKey3}.
    (5:252) with table %myTable put {%hello} in it at key {myKey4}.
    (5:252) with table %myTable put {%hello} in it at key {myKey5}.
    (5:252) with table %myTable put {%hello} in it at key {myKey6}.
    (5:252) with table %myTable put {%hello} in it at key {myKey7}.
    (6:250) for each entry in table %myTable put it into %entry,
        (5:102) print {%entry} to the console.
        (5:150) take variable %i and add 1 to it.
        (5:102) print {%i} to the console.
    (6:454) after the loop is done,
        (5:102) print {I'm done!} to the console.
        (1:108) and variable %myTable is table,
            (5:101) set %myTable[myKey1] to 123
            (5:102) print {%myTable[myKey1]} to the console.

(0:0) when the script is started,
    (5:101) set %answer to 0
    (5:101) set %life to 42
    (6:450) while variable %answer is not %life,
        (5:150) take variable %answer and add 1 to it.
        (1:102) and variable %answer equals 21,
            (5:450) exit the current loop.
    (6:454) after the loop is done,
        (5:102) print {We may never know the answer...} to the console.
</code></pre>
<p>The above script creates a table in the first Trigger block, iterates over
that table with Flow trigger (6:250) and after it prints &quot;I'm done!&quot; to the
console.  The last Trigger block attempts to answer that very important
universal question but fails because we may never know the answer...</p>
<p>To execute the <a href="#advanced-usage">Advanced Usage</a> example, it is no different
than <a href="#basic-usage">Basic Usage</a>'s execution example.</p>
