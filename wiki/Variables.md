### Variables

#### What is it?
Variables are a way of storing something, in Monkeyspeak's case it is strings or 
numbers.

#### Break Down
Monkeyspeak Variables start with a `%` sign.  This is configurable to your liking 
via Options found in the MonkeyspeakEngine class.  For all examples, we will use the 
defaults.  Variables can have `_,#,@,$,&,0-9,a-z,A-Z` (no commas).  So a Variable 
called `%__@v$a#r&_` you can create but you might get a headache typing that out all 
the time.
