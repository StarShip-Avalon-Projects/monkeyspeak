### Strings

#### What is it?
A word, a phrase, a sentence.  Strings are made up of all of those, the simplest explanation 
is that this entire paragraph is a string.  In Monkeyspeak, Strings are surrounded by a 
`{` and `}` (configurable but we will use the defaults for simplicity).

#### Break Down
Monkeyspeak Strings can contain Variables, the Variable's value is converted unless a @ is 
at the beginning of the string.  Strings are optionally limited to a certain amount, the 
default is 1000 characters.  You can think of characters as each individual letter in the 
alphabet.  Combined they would make a String that is 24 characters in length.
